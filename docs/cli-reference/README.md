# Command line reference

`kubecfg` is a CLI that allows you to generate Kubernetes resource manifests locally (in `jsonnet`, `JSON`, or `YAML` format) and synchronize them with your remote cluster(s).

*The files in this directory enumerate each of the possible `kubecfg` commands and their flags. Note that you can also find this info with the CLI itself, using the `--help` flag.*
